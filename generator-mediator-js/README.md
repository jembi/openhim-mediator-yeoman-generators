# generator-mediator-js


## Getting Started

### How to use our friend Yeoman to generate a new mediator

```bash
npm install -g yo
```

To install generator-mediator-js from npm, run:

```bash
npm install -g generator-mediator-js
```

Or for dev purposes, from the generator-mediator-js directory, run:

```bash
sudo npm link
```

Finally, from a clean directory into which you would like to install the mediator:

```bash
yo mediator-js
```

You will be prompted to enter the config needed to create the mediator, to use default config:

```bash
yo mediator-js --useDefaults --name="Mediator Name" --description="This is what my mediator does"
```
